# French App
This is my **Fourth android project**. It is an app which **displays** some **English** Numbers, Family Members, Colors and Phrases **translations in French**.
Also there is an **Audio button** for each English to French translation. But I couldn't find french pronounciation audio for each one of them so they are not added.
In this android project I learned about **Intents**, **OnClickListener**, **Visibility**, **ListView**, **Adapter Class**, **MediaPlayer** and **AudioManager** in android.
