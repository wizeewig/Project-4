# French App
This is my fourth android project. It is an app which displays some English Numbers, Family Members, Colors and Phrases translations in French.
Also there is an audio button for each English to French translation. But I couldn't find french pronounciation audio for each one of them so they are not added.
In this android project I learned about Intents, OnClickListener, Visibility, ListView and MediaPlayer in android.
